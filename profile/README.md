# VanticLab

> **Observation-first AI teammates** that remove friction from day‑to‑day knowledge work. We watch how teams actually operate, surface hidden drag points, and respond with automation people can trust.

## 🎯 What We Build

### 🤖 Vantic Agent
AI colleague for Australian SMEs that learns by watching workflows, identifies friction, and suggests/executes improvements without brittle integrations.

### 🧩 Pattern Intelligence Engine  
Internal platform that turns observed tasks into reusable automations through experimentation, telemetry capture, and feedback loops.

### 📚 Virtual Data Room (VDR)
Investor-grade single source of truth combining legal, R&D, financial, and GTM documentation with automated conversion pipelines.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

- **`vantic-agent`** — Product code, pilots, and deployment
- **`pattern-intelligence-engine`** — Research, experimentation, and telemetry

- **`.github`** — Organization profile and workflows

*Note: Some repositories may be private. See "Investor Access" below.*

## 🎯 How We Work

1. **🔍 Observe before automating** — Spend time inside workflows, measure friction, ship tooling only where it compounds value
2. **📚 Write the playbook** — Every system ships with an operations guide
3. **⚡ Bias for shipping loops** — Tight feedback cycles over large-batch releases  
4. **🛡️ Security & trust first** — Guardrails, auditing, and consent as product features
